        <h1>Nan Goldin</h1>
        <p>Nan Goldin (September 12, 1953) is a photographer from the US. She started her photography career by focusing on the post-punk new-wave music scene in Boston. Between 1979 and 1986, she created her most important body of work, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.

            These images portrayed drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments. She sees it as a diary that she would let people read.</p>
